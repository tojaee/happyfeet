            <p class = "text"> In the small stuff, Abs, you make my heart race,
                With pretty eyes, a gaze that seeks my trace.
                            
                When I say nice things, you hide a cute grin,	
                Your laughter's the best when we're joking within.
                
                Your nose is cute, fits your face just right,
                And your voice is a tune I could hear day and night.
                
                All these little things about you, it's true,
                They deepen my love and appreciation for you.
                
                You light up the room with your joyful air,
                Being kind and making others feel rare.
                
                Life with you is an exciting ride,
                Turning normal moments into memories, side by side.
                
                It's not just looks, it's your personality too,
                Making the world brighter, that's you.
                
                Abs, all these little things you do,
                Make me love and appreciate, you
                </p>
